Resume Data Extraction with LangChain & Ollama

Built an AI-powered application using LangChain and ChatOllama to automatically extract structured data from unstructured resumes (PDFs). The system processes resume content to identify and extract key fields like name, email, university, degree, company, and job title, outputting the information in JSON format. This project leverages ChatOllama's capabilities to create intelligent chat-based models for document processing, streamlining resume data extraction for recruitment and HR automation.
